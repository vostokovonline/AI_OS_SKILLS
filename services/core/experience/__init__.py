"""
Experience Engine - Core Learning Loop for AI-OS

This module turns executions into learning.

Architecture:
    Execution → Experience → SkillStats → Better Skill Selection

Components:
- Experience: Single execution record
- SkillStats: Aggregated skill performance
- ExperienceEngine: Orchestrates recording and learning
- SkillStatsService: Updates statistics
- SkillStatsCache: In-memory cache for real-time access
- Repositories: Database operations

Usage:
    from experience import experience_engine, get_skill_stats_sync

    # Record experience
    await experience_engine.record_experience(
        session=session,
        goal_id=goal.id,
        task_type="web_search",
        skill_id="web.search",
        success=True,
        confidence=0.95,
        latency_ms=1234
    )

    # Get cached stats
    stats = await get_skill_stats_sync()
